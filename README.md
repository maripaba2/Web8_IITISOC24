# Hostel Attendance Management

Our project is a comprehensive web application designed to accurately log the arrivals and departures of hostel residents. With this website, hostellers can easily mark their attendance using a face recognition feature, ensuring a streamlined and efficient tracking system. If a hosteller is late, an automated notification will be sent to the hosteller. Additionally, the platform features an analytics dashboard that provides detailed insights into attendance trends.
